# 🤖 AI Use in This Class: Expectations & Best Practices

AI tools can be **powerful supports** when used properly and **major obstacles** when used poorly. In this class, AI is treated like any other professional tool: it can help you think, plan, and improve your work, but it **cannot replace your thinking, creativity, or technical skill**.

This page explains **when AI use is appropriate**, **when it is not**, and **what is expected of you** across all course focus areas.

---

## 🎯 The Big Idea

AI should help you:
- Think more clearly
- Plan more effectively
- Solve problems
- Improve your work through feedback

AI should **not**:
- Do the work for you
- Replace skill development
- Remove decision-making from the process

If AI is doing the *core creative or technical work*, it is being misused.

---

## ✅ Good Times to Use AI

AI is encouraged when it supports **thinking, planning, and refinement**.

### 🧠 Planning & Idea Development
- Brainstorming project ideas
- Refining a vague idea into a clear one
- Stress-testing whether a project is realistic
- Helping generate questions, outlines, or checklists

**Example:**  
“Help me turn this idea into a clearer project plan.”

---

### ✍️ Writing Support (Notion, Proposals, Reflections)
- Rewording ideas more clearly
- Checking tone and clarity
- Expanding reflections *based on your own notes*
- Helping structure an explanation

**Example:**  
“I wrote this reflection. Help me improve clarity without changing the meaning.”

---

### 🛠️ Technical Problem-Solving
- Troubleshooting software issues
- Explaining how a tool works
- Helping you understand *why* something went wrong
- Suggesting workflows or efficiency tips

**Example:**  
“My audio isn’t exporting correctly in Premiere. What are common causes?”

---

### 🎨 Feedback & Revision
- Asking for critique on work you already created
- Identifying areas for improvement
- Comparing two design choices

**Example:**  
“Here is my poster layout. What could be clearer or more effective?”

---

## ❌ Bad Times to Use AI

AI is **not allowed** when it replaces your learning or creative output.

### 🚫 Creating the Final Product for You
- Writing full scripts, reflections, or proposals from scratch
- Designing posters or graphics for you
- Generating full video concepts shot-for-shot
- Producing finished copy you did not meaningfully write

If the work does not sound, look, or think like *you*, it is a problem.

---

### 🚫 Replacing Skill Development
- Letting AI decide edits instead of learning Premiere
- Letting AI design instead of practicing Photoshop
- Letting AI generate models instead of designing in TinkerCAD

You are here to **build skills**, not outsource them.

---

### 🚫 Hiding AI Use
- Copying AI output without understanding it
- Submitting AI-generated work as your own thinking
- Avoiding effort by “letting AI handle it”

If you cannot explain your work, you did not do the work.

---

## 🎬 AI Use by Course Area

### 🎬 Premiere Pro
**Appropriate**
- Help planning a shot list or structure
- Troubleshooting export or audio issues
- Feedback on pacing or clarity

**Not Appropriate**
- Writing full scripts or voiceovers for you
- Deciding all edits or transitions
- Replacing hands-on editing practice

---

### 🖼️ Photoshop
**Appropriate**
- Brainstorming layout ideas
- Getting feedback on hierarchy or clarity
- Help understanding tools or effects

**Not Appropriate**
- Generating final designs
- Choosing all colors, fonts, and layouts
- Skipping the design process

---

### 🛠️ 3D Printing
**Appropriate**
- Brainstorming functional solutions
- Thinking through design constraints
- Troubleshooting print issues

**Not Appropriate**
- Generating full models
- Avoiding iteration and testing
- Printing designs you do not understand

---

## 🧾 Transparency & Responsibility

You are expected to:
- Use AI **intentionally**
- Be able to **explain your decisions**
- Show evidence of **process and iteration**
- Own your final work

You may be asked:
- How AI helped you
- What decisions you made yourself
- Why you chose a specific approach

Not being able to answer these questions is a red flag.

---

## ⚠️ Bottom Line

AI is a **tool**, not a shortcut.

If AI helps you:
- Think better → good  
- Learn faster → good  
- Work more professionally → good  

If AI helps you:
- Avoid thinking → not okay  
- Avoid learning → not okay  
- Avoid effort → not okay  

When in doubt, ask.

Using AI well is a skill. Using it poorly will hurt your learning.
