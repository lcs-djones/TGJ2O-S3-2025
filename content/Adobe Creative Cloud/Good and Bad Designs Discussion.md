**Step 1 – Find Examples (2–3 minutes):**  
With your group (2–4 people), find **two different designs** online — this could be posters, ads, album covers, or logos.

- One should be a design you think is **strong**.
    
- One should be a design you think is **weak**.
    

**Step 2 – Discuss (5 minutes):**  
As a group, talk about:

- Why does the “strong” design work well?
    
- Why does the “weak” design not work?
    
- What choices (colours, fonts, images, layout, balance) made the difference?
    

**Step 3 – Share Back (5 minutes):**  
Be ready to quickly show your two examples to the class and explain your reasoning.

💡 _Remember: These are the same kinds of design choices you’ll be making in Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Tinkercad soon!_
