 Course Philosophy and Big Picture

This course is designed to simulate the experience of working in a real media and entertainment organization. Instead of traditional assignments, you will take on the role of a content creator producing videos, posters, podcasts, promotional materials, and 3D printed objects that serve actual purposes within the school community. You will be working with real clients such as sports teams, clubs, and event organizers to create content that is published and shared. The result is a highly engaging, real-world learning experience that builds both technical skill and creative independence.

This class will challenge you to take initiative, collaborate effectively, and manage your time like a professional. In return, you will leave with a portfolio of authentic work and a deeper understanding of what it means to produce media that matters.

Tools and Technical Foundations

We will work with a wide range of professional tools, including:

- Adobe Creative Suite, such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro
    
- TinkerCAD and 3D printing software
    
- DSLR cameras, laser cutters, and audio equipment, where available
    

The goal is not to master every tool, but to become confident using the platforms and equipment you need to bring your ideas to life. Instruction in these tools will take place in the first unit to ensure everyone, regardless of prior experience, starts with a shared foundation.

### The Five Focus Areas

You will complete at least one major project in each of the following areas:

1. Design thinking and object creation, including 3D printing and laser cutting
    
2. Video production
    
3. Audio production
    
4. Photography, including both shooting and editing
    
5. Print and web layout or design
    

Some projects may blend multiple areas, but each must focus on one category as its primary purpose. This ensures that you gain well-rounded experience in communications technology.

### Modular Structure: Four Phases of Learning

The school year is divided into four learning modules:

- **Mod 1: Foundations Bootcamp**  
    A structured, teacher-guided unit where you will complete short tasks in each focus area. Each week introduces a new tool or creative discipline, helping you build essential skills and knowledge before moving on to more independent work.
    
- **Mods 2 through 4: Self-Directed Project Modules**  
    In these units, you will pitch your own project ideas or be assigned one based on your interests. Each pitch must include a clear goal, a realistic timeline, a list of tools and equipment needed, and an explanation of how your work connects to the curriculum and school community. You will be responsible for staying on track and meeting your deadlines, just like a real media professional.

### Notion and Daily Workflow

We will use **Notion** to manage your work throughout the course. Notion will serve as your:

- Daily journal, where you will track what you worked on, what problems you solved, and what your next steps are
    
- Project planner, where you will write and submit project pitches and timelines
    
- Digital portfolio, where you will upload final projects and submit process evidence and reflections
    

You are expected to complete short Notion updates every class. These entries help demonstrate how you are using your time and developing your projects, and they are a key part of your assessment.

### Project Pitches and Time Management

During self-directed modules, you will operate like a freelance media producer. You are expected to spend the equivalent hours of class that week working on your project. This time can include both in-class and out-of-class activities. For example, you may attend games to film footage, conduct interviews during lunch hours, or work on edits at home. This flexibility means that if you are staying on track, you can use in-class time for other productive coursework as needed.

However, if you fall behind or fail to use time productively, your ability to work independently may be adjusted. The freedom offered in this course relies on trust, accountability, and careful planning.

### Authentic Learning Opportunities

The projects in this course are not made-up scenarios. You will create real media products for real people. That may include:

- Documenting a club, team, or school event
    
- Designing posters or promotional campaigns
    
- Recording interviews with staff or students
    
- Producing podcasts or video series for a school audience
    
- Designing 3D printed awards, props, or signage
    

These are meaningful contributions to the school community. The work you do will be used, seen, and appreciated, and it gives you valuable experience that connects to careers in journalism, marketing, graphic design, production, and engineering.

### Assessment and Evaluation – KTCA Framework

You will be assessed using the Ontario Ministry of Education’s KTCA model. Each category is weighted equally:

|Category|Description|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|**Knowledge**|Your understanding of tools, terminology, and creative principles. This will be assessed mainly in Mod 1.|25%|
|**Thinking**|How you plan, pitch, and revise your projects. This includes idea generation, proposal writing, and time management.|25%|
|**Application**|Your technical execution, such as shooting video, taking photographs, recording audio, or designing in 3D.|25%|
|**Communication**|The quality and clarity of your final product and how effectively it communicates with your intended audience. You must also share your final work, either through digital platforms or school channels.|25%|

You will receive feedback throughout the process, including checkpoints during planning, production, and completion stages.

### Final Thoughts and Classroom Culture

This is not a traditional class, and it doesn’t run like one. You will not be given daily worksheets or step-by-step instructions once we begin self-directed work. You will be expected to manage your time, keep yourself accountable, and push your creative limits. In return, you will build a real portfolio, gain experience using professional tools, and make meaningful contributions to our school.

Our classroom will run like a creative studio—collaborative, respectful, and focused. Take your work seriously, be open to feedback, and support your classmates in their creative journeys. This course is a launchpad for your ideas and your growth as a media creator.
