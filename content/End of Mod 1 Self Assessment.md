This task is **not optional**, it is a required part of the course. Take this reflection seriously and answer each question thoughtfully. Your responses will be **taken into consideration when determining your grade**, as they help demonstrate your understanding, effort, and engagement throughout the Mod. The more **honest and detailed** you are, the more valuable your reflection will be for both you and me.
