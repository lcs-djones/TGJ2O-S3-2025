# ⏰ Late Submissions & Notion Expectations

This page outlines how late submissions are handled in this course, how they impact learning skills on your report card, and your responsibilities when using Notion for project submissions.

---

## 📉 Late Submissions and Learning Skills

Submitting work late does not just affect the academic assessment of a project. It directly impacts **Learning Skills**, particularly:

- **Responsibility**
- **Organization**
- **Independent Work**
- **Initiative**

Consistently late or missing submissions indicate difficulty meeting expectations, managing time, and following established processes. These patterns are reflected on report cards, regardless of the quality of the final product once it is eventually submitted.

Completing strong work late does not offset the learning skill concerns created by missed deadlines.

---

## 🤝 Trust, Responsibility, and Open Projects

Many projects in this course are intentionally **open-ended**. This flexibility exists because it mirrors real-world creative and technical work and requires a high level of trust.

With that flexibility comes responsibility:
- Planning your time realistically  
- Communicating clearly when issues arise  
- Following submission procedures exactly  

When deadlines are missed, that trust is weakened. Repeated issues may result in more structured, restricted project formats moving forward.

## 🗂️ Notion Submissions: How Work Is Checked

Notion is used as a **daily workflow and reflection tool**, not just a storage space.

Important clarification:
- I **only review the most recent Notion post for that class day**
- I do **not** routinely go back and re-check older posts
- If work is submitted or updated in an **older post**, I will not see it unless you take action

## 🔔 Required Action for Late Work in Old Notion Posts

>[!warning]
>If you submit or update work in an **older Notion post**, you **must** tag me in the post using @David Jones so that I receive and email.

This is the only way I receive a notification that an older post has been updated.

### 🚫 If you do NOT tag me:
- I will not see the submission  
- Overdues in Edsby will **not** be changed  
- The work will remain marked as missing or late  

---

## 📊 Edsby and Accountability

Edsby reflects what I can verify has been submitted and assessed.

If a submission:
- Is late  
- Is placed in an old Notion post  
- Is not tagged correctly  

It will remain overdue in Edsby until properly brought to my attention.

This is not a punishment. It is a systems-based expectation that mirrors professional workflows, where unclear communication results in work being missed.

## ✅ Final Reminder

Notion gives you flexibility. Open projects give you freedom. Both require maturity and accountability.

If you are unsure where or how to submit something, ask **before** the deadline, not after.

Managing your submissions properly is part of the learning in this course.
