In this course, students will be assessed using the KTCA framework, with each category representing 25% of the final grade. Knowledge will be demonstrated through the completion of tutorials and structured lessons in the first module, while Thinking, Application, and Communication will be emphasized during independent and group projects. Thinking evaluates the planning and originality of project ideas, Application focuses on the technical execution and collection of assets, and Communication assesses how effectively the final product conveys its message to an audience. A studentâ€™s grade is also heavily influenced by their Notion portfolio, which serves as an ongoing record of their work, growth, and evidence of learning. Students are expected to complete a detailed portfolio entry after every class, documenting their progress, reflecting on challenges, and showing the detail and evidence that supports their final projects. Together, these elements ensure a fair evaluation of both the learning process and the outcomes produced.
