notes: If students are stuck on choosing a song or artist, suggest something instrumental
  or genre-based (e.g. “lo-fi beats” or “epic fantasy soundtrack”) to help them focus
  more on design.

## 🎵 Album Art Reimagined

Your task: create a custom album cover based on any **song**, **musical artist**, or **vibe/genre** of your choice.

---

> [!NOTE]
> You **do not** need to use every tool or tutorial technique we've covered.
>
> However, by now you should be able to confidently use a wide variety of tools — and be able to name at least **10** specific things you changed, edited, or added in your final piece.
>
> Your “10 Changes” will be submitted as a short written list alongside your final album art.

## Step 1: Choose Your Music

Pick a song, artist, or type of music as inspiration. Try to match your design’s *tone* and *energy* to the sound.

Examples:
- A dark grunge track → gritty, desaturated photo with sharp contrast  
- A summer pop hit → vibrant colors, bold fonts, playful layout  
- A moody instrumental → blurred shapes, cool tones, layered textures

---

## Step 2: Design Your Album Cover

Create a **square canvas** (e.g. 2000px by 2000px) and start building your cover.

What to include:
- A background image or abstract design  
- Artist name and album title (with styled text)  
- Visual elements that reflect mood or theme  
- Optional border or framing

## Step 3: Use Your Tools

You’ve learned how to:
- Brighten or darken photos  
- Enhance specific colors  
- Use Magic Wand or Lasso tools to cut out objects  
- Add, transform, or style text  
- Use masks and layer effects  
- Resize and crop content  
- Remove distractions or retouch photos  
- Create outlines, gradients, and more

> [!TIP]
> Keep it clean and intentional — don’t overdo every effect just to show that you can.

## Step 4: Submit Your Work

1. Save your PSD file and export a PNG or JPG of your final album cover  
2. Upload both files to your Notion portfolio
3. Include a short written list of **10 changes/techniques** you used  
   - A bullet-point list is fine!
