# Photoshop Project: Magazine Cover

## Overview
For this project, you will design a **magazine cover** that looks professional, creative, and polished. Your cover should include strong visuals, text, and layout choices that make it look like something you could see on a store shelf.  

This project will take **3 classes** and will showcase your ability to combine multiple Photoshop skills into one cohesive piece.

## Requirements
Your magazine cover must include:  
- A clear **title/masthead** (name of your magazine)  
- At least **3 headlines** related to your chosen theme (these should look like real cover lines, not random text)  
- A **main feature image** that is the central focus of your design  
- Additional **design elements** (backgrounds, shapes, icons, or logos) to add depth and realism  
- A **barcode** (provided in resources or make your own) to finish the look

## Process
1. **Choose a Theme**  
   Examples: fashion, gaming, sports, travel, music, technology, lifestyle.  
   Think about your audience — who is this magazine for?  

2. **Sketch the Layout on Paper**  
   Plan the design with a simple drawing to map out your placement.  

3. **Collect Assets**  
   Gather stock photos, personal photos, and textures that will support your theme.  

4. **Design in Photoshop**  
   Use your knowledge of layers, text, and effects to carefully lay out your cover.  

5. **Polish and Export**  
   Make sure everything lines up cleanly, is readable, and has a balanced composition. Export as a high-quality JPG or PNG.

## Effects & Techniques to Include
To avoid a simple “text on top of a picture,” you must use at least **7 of the following Photoshop techniques** in your final product:  

- Layer masks (e.g., placing text behind part of your subject)  
- Blending modes (for overlays or subtle effects)  
- Gradient or colour overlays  
- Drop shadows / strokes on text  
- Adjustment layers (brightness/contrast, hue/saturation, colour balance, etc.)  
- Text effects (warp, 3D style, or blending options)  
- Shape layers with opacity or gradients for text backgrounds  
- Clipping masks (e.g., text filled with an image or pattern)  
- Select & Mask tools (to cut out your subject cleanly)  

>[!tips]
>Make sure you note on your Notion entry what techniques you use and where!

## Step 1: Paper Sketch (First Look)
Before you begin in Photoshop, you must create a **rough sketch of your magazine cover layout on paper**.  

Your sketch should:  
- Show where the **masthead/title** will go  
- Indicate the **main image area**  
- Place at least **3 headlines** in logical positions  
- Include space for a **barcode** and any extra design elements  

Take a photo of your sketch and upload it to your Notion entry. This step ensures you have a clear plan before jumping into Photoshop.

## Peer Feedback

Show your **paper sketch** of your magazine cover to a peer. The peer should give you **3 pieces of constructive feedback** about your design.  
This feedback can focus on your **theme, layout, readability of text, choice of images, or overall design balance**.  

The three pieces of constructive feedback that you receive should be included in your Notion post, so make sure you write them down!

>[!remember] Constructive feedback needs to be
>1. Helpful  
>2. Specific  
>3. Kind  

>[!example]  
>> "It looks cool, I like it a lot. Maybe move stuff around a bit" is **KIND**, but it is not **SPECIFIC** or **HELPFUL**.  
>>  
>> "Your masthead is really bold and catches the eye. The side headlines look good, but some of them are too close to the edge and may be hard to read. If you shift them inward slightly and use a consistent font size, your cover will look more polished and professional" is an example of **GOOD** peer feedback.  

## Success Criteria
Your magazine cover will be assessed based on:  
- **Creativity**: originality of theme and design choices  
- **Technical Skill**: effective use of Photoshop tools and techniques  
- **Layout & Design**: professional-looking arrangement of text and images  
- **Polish**: overall visual appeal, alignment, readability, and finishing details

## Deliverables
- A **photo of your paper sketch** uploaded to your Notion entry  
- Final exported **JPG or PNG** uploaded to your Notion page  
- Upload your **PSD** (photoshop) file
- A **short reflection** (3–4 sentences) on what techniques you used and how they improved your design
