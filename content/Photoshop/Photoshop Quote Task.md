## Create a Motivational Quote Graphic

You’ve just completed several Photoshop tutorials, including how to:

- Add and edit text
- Place text inside a shape
- Adjust letter spacing (kerning)
- Transform text to match perspective
- Apply layer styles (e.g., outline or glow)
- Add in visual effects

Now it’s time to *use* those skills in a short creative task.

## Your Task

Create a **motivational quote graphic** using Photoshop.

This will be designed like something you might see shared on social media — featuring a powerful quote layered over an image, with clear design choices that help tell a story.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Quote

Your quote should be **inspirational or thought-provoking**, and **school appropriate**.

It can come from:
- A movie
- A song lyric
- A video game
- A book
- A well-known historical or public figure

> [!NOTE]
> Keep your quote under 20 words. Shorter is often better for visual design.

**Examples:**
- *“Do, or do not. There is no try.”* – Yoda  
- *“Still I rise.”* – Maya Angelou  
- *“It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this.”* – The Legend of Zelda  
- *“Lose yourself in the music.”* – Eminem

## Step 2: Find or Create a Background

Choose an image that fits the *vibe* of your quote.

- You can use a free image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- Or, create your own background using gradients, shapes, or abstract textures

## Step 3: Add and Style Your Quote

Use the tools you practiced in the tutorials:

✅ At least **two separate text elements**  
✅ One text element with **adjusted kerning**  
✅ One text element using a **layer style** (like stroke or shadow)  
✅ One example of **text inside a shape** OR **transformed perspective**

> [!TIP]
> Experiment with size, alignment, and color contrast. The most important part is that the text is **readable** and **expressive**.

---

## Step 4: Add a Signature

Include your name or initials in small text somewhere in the design — this is your digital signature.

---

## Step 5: Export and Submit

When finished:

1. Save your Photoshop file (`.psd`)
2. Export as a **.JPG** or **.PNG**
3. Upload both files to your Notion portfolio with screenshots and thoughtful reflection included

> [!NOTE]
> We need the Photoshop file in case we revisit this later.
