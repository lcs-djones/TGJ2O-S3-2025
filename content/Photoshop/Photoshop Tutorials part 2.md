## Photoshop Tutorial Challenge: Skill Building Sprint

Now that you've explored the basic Photoshop workspace and completed some of the text-focused tutorials, it’s time to go deeper into the **photo-editing side** of Photoshop.

In this sprint, you'll complete short, guided tutorials across several categories: **Paint, Select and Mask, Adjust Lighting, Enhance Color, Resize, Retouch**, and more.

> **This may *look* like a lot**, but don’t panic!
>
> The **majority of these tutorials take under 1 minute to complete**, especially the beginner-level ones. Many involve only 2–3 clicks to apply an effect or use a tool.
