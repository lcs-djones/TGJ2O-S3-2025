## Getting Started with Photoshop Tutorials

Adobe Photoshop is one of the most powerful tools in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. To help you get familiar with the basics (and some more advanced tools), Adobe provides a built-in set of **interactive tutorials**.

These tutorials walk you through tools and techniques *step-by-step* – no guessing, no switching tabs.

Whether you are brand new to Photoshop, or an experienced editor, these tools are a great way to gain a bearing on the app and all of its capabilities.

You'll begin by simply launching Photoshop and navigating to the tutorial panel.

---

## Step 1: Launch Photoshop

Make sure you're logged in to Creative Cloud with your school credentials.

Open **Adobe Photoshop** from the Creative Cloud app or your Applications folder.

## Step 2: Open the “Help” Tab

As soon as Photoshop opens, look at the top right-hand side of the **Menu Bar**. You should see a panel that says **“Help”**.

Click on it.

Navigate to the menu called **"Hands-On Tutorials"**

> [!TIP]
> You will also notice that there is a search option in the Help tab, this is great for if you forget how to do something and want a quick solution
>
> Whenever you are stuck in this class, ask the program, then ask the internet, then a classmate and then Mr. Jones (in that order)

## Step 3: Choose a Tutorial

The Hands-On Tutorial panel contains several guided tutorials. Start by selecting the beginner options and starting with **"Orientation"**:

The tutorials you will complete under the **"Orientation"** section are (roughly 21 minutes completion)
- **Get to know the app**
- **Get to know layers**
- **Get to know selections**
- **Get to know layer masks**
- **Get to know adjustment layers**

Each one includes:
- Visual instructions
- Highlighted tools
- A practice file to work with


> [!NOTE]
> You can complete more than the **"Orientation"** tutorials if you're moving quickly! Take your time and actually *try* the tools as you go. 

---

## Step 4: Follow Along

Each tutorial opens a sample file and gives you direct prompts inside Photoshop.

- **Do not** skip the practice steps.
- Try hovering your mouse over icons if you're unsure what they do.
- Use the **Undo** shortcut often (`Command + Z`) to backtrack.

## Step 5: Reflect and Screenshot

When you've finished a tutorial:
1. Take a screenshot of your completed file or workspace.
2. Save your work to your course folder.
3. Upload your screenshot to your Notion post for today to show your completed tutorials

> [!TIP]
> On a Mac, you can take a screenshot of a selected portion of the screen by pressing `Command + Shift + 4`(or `Command + Shift + Control + 4` to copy the image to your clipboard).

## What’s Next?

Once you’ve completed all tutorials under **"Orientation"** and submitted your screenshots, you’ll be ready for the next tutorials under the **"Beginner"** category, **Add Text**, **Add visual effects** and **Composite**

These tutorials are:

**Add Text** (roughly 13 minutes completion):
- Create and edit text
- Add text and shapes to an image for social media

- Add text inside a shape
- Use a layer style to create hollow outline text
- Transform text to match perspective in a photo

**Add visual effects** (roughly 6 minutes completion):

## Task
When you completed all of the tutorials under "Orientation", "Add Text" and "Add Visual Effects", you can move on to the task for today, making a [[Photoshop Quote Task|Quote Poster]]

## Troubleshooting

- If Photoshop is slow to open, try restarting your computer.
- If the Learn or Help tab aren’t showing up, make sure your Creative Cloud is fully up to date.
- If you’re ever stuck, raise your hand and I’ll help — or ask a peer!
