# 🎬 Mini Project: *A Day in 6 Clips*

## Overview
Now that you’ve completed the **Premiere Pro tutorials**, it’s time to put those skills into practice with a short, creative project.  
In this activity, you’ll make a **20–30 second video** called **“A Day in 6 Clips.”** The goal is to use everything you just learned, importing, trimming, arranging, adding titles, and exporting, to tell a short visual story.

This is meant to be light, fun, and quick. You’ll be surprised how much you can do in a class with what you already know!

## 🪜 Steps

### 1️⃣ Collect Your Footage
Gather **6 short video clips** (5–10 seconds each).  
These can be:
- From your phone (explicit permission from me to use your phone) or computer   
- Downloaded from free stock sites (e.g., Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash Video)  
- Or from the **Sample Media** folder inside Premiere Pro  

Your clips can show moments from your day, a hobby, nature around you, or anything that tells a quick story.

### 2️⃣ Import and Organize
- Import your clips into Premiere Pro  
- Create a new sequence  
- Drag your clips into the timeline and arrange them in a logical or creative order  

---

### 3️⃣ Edit and Trim
- Trim your clips so your total video is **30-90 seconds long**  
- Use what you learned in the “Move and Trim Clips” tutorial to make smooth transitions between shots  

---

### 4️⃣ Add Polish
Include the following elements:
- **At least one transition** (e.g., cross dissolve or dip to black)  
- **A short title** at the beginning (e.g., *A Day in 6 Clips*)  
- **Your name** at the end  
- Optional: make **basic color adjustments** or add **background music** (from sample media or royalty-free sites)
