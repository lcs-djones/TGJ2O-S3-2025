## 🌐 Explore Royalty-Free Media Sites

While Premiere Pro installs, take some time to explore and collect assets that you can use in your future video or graphic design projects.

## ⚠️ What is a Copyright Issue?

A **copyright issue** happens when you use someone else’s creative work — like music, images, or video — **without permission**. Just because something is on the internet doesn’t mean it’s free to use. Using copyrighted material without the proper rights can lead to videos being taken down, projects being flagged, or even legal trouble. That’s why we stick to **royalty-free** or properly licensed content whenever possible.

---

## What does “royalty-free” mean?

**Royalty-free** media means you can legally use it in your own projects **without paying the creator each time it’s used**. These resources are often free to download and don't require a license for classroom or personal creative use.

Why this matters:
- You can safely use these images, videos, and sounds in your school projects  
- You don’t have to worry about copyright issues  
- It’s what many professionals use when creating content quickly

> [!WARNING]
> Royalty-free ≠ “no credit ever.” Some platforms still recommend or require attribution, especially for audio.

## Step 1: Visit These Sites

Check out the following **trusted royalty-free media platforms**. Feel free to explore all of them — they’re safe and used by creators worldwide.

## Step 2: Save Files to Your Existing Folders

Use the **Video Editing folder structure** you created earlier.

As you download media files, save them to the appropriate subfolder:
