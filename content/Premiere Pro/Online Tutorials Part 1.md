# 🎓 Premiere Pro Online Tutorials (Backup Option)

## Introduction
If the **built-in Premiere Pro tutorials** aren’t working on your computer, you’ll complete this set of **official Adobe online tutorials** instead. These cover the same essential tools and skills you need to get started editing in Premiere Pro — everything from importing clips to adjusting timing and exporting your final video.

You can do this quickly by pressing:

>### **Command + Tab**  
This lets you toggle instantly between open applications so you can follow each step without slowing down.


>[!tip] Each tutorial includes **practice files to download**. Make sure to **save these files in a clearly labeled folder** (for example, “Premiere Tutorials”) so that your workspace stays organized and easy to manage.

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep your downloads tidy — each tutorial will give you new clips or project files. Label each folder with the tutorial name before starting (e.g., “01 - Get to Know Premiere Pro”).
