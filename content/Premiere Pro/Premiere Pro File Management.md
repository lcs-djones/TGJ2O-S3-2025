## 🎥 Set Up Your Project Folder Structure

Before we start editing, let’s get your workspace organized.

---

## Why bother?

When you’re working on a video project — especially in Premiere Pro — your files need to stay **organized** or you’ll end up wasting time searching for footage, losing track of audio, or breaking links between your files and your project.

Professional editors follow consistent folder structures to:

- Keep their media easy to find  
- Prevent broken files in Premiere  
- Stay focused and efficient  

You’ll thank yourself later.

## Step 1: Create Your Folders

On your computer (or external drive), create a new main folder called: Video Editing


Inside that folder, create these subfolders:

Footage/ All raw video clips go here  
Audio/  Music, voiceovers, and sound effects  
Graphics/  Logos, overlays, lower thirds, etc.  
Exports/  Finished video files  
Premiere Projects/  Your .prproj files

> [!TIP]
> Don’t just drag everything into one folder called “stuff.”  
> Premiere will link to wherever the file is stored, if it gets moved or renamed later, it can break your project.

## Step 2: Make It a Template

Once you've built your folder structure, **duplicate it** and use it as a starting point every time you begin a new project.

Optional: Rename your top-level folder with the project name relating to the subject matter/project
