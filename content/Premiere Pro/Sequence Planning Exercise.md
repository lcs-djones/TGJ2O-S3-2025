# 🎞️ Sequence Planning Exercise  
### Premiere Pro Introduction Activity

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
Before learning the tools in Premiere Pro, it’s important to understand how editors tell stories through **sequence and pacing** — the order of shots and how long they’re shown for.  
Even without sound, effects, or titles, the **sequence** alone can completely change how a story feels.  

In this activity, you’ll use a shared set of still images to plan your own short “film sequence.” This will help you start thinking like an editor before you ever open Premiere Pro.

## 🪜 Instructions  

### Step 1: Open the Slideshow  
Click the slideshow link provided below. It contains a series of **photos that can be rearranged** to tell different stories.  
> 🖼️ You’ll all have the same set of images.

### Step 2: Rearrange the Images  
Your goal is to arrange the photos into a sequence that tells a clear, engaging story.  
You can:  
- Reorder the images in any way you like  
- **Delete** any images you don’t want to use  
- **Do not add** new images — work only with what’s provided  

Think about:  
- What story do these images tell in your chosen order?  
- What is the beginning, middle, and end?  
- What mood or emotion are you trying to create?  

---

### Step 3: Title Your Sequence  
Once you’re happy with your story, give it a short **title** that fits the tone or theme (e.g., *The Big Test*, *Lost and Found*, *Game Day*, *The Long Walk Home*).

---

### Step 4: Share Your Work  
When your sequence is complete:  
1. Copy the **share link** to your slideshow.  
2. Paste that link into your Notion post for today (see below).

### ✅ Submission Reminder  
Your Notion entry should include:  
- A **title** for your story  
- The **share link** to your slideshow  
- Thoughtful answers to the reflection questions above  

Make sure your link works and your reflections show effort and understanding.
