## 🗂️ File Management & What to Submit

In this class, it’s important that you stay organized and submit the correct files to Notion to show your progress and learning.

Every time you finish a Premiere Pro editing task or project, you are expected to upload **3 things** to your Notion entry.

---

## ✅ What to Submit

### 1. 📸 A Screenshot of Your Timeline

Take a screenshot of your **Premiere Pro timeline** to show your editing process.

> [!TIP]
> Use `Command + Shift + 4` on a Mac to take a screenshot of just your Premiere Pro window.

This shows that you're not just dragging in one clip — you're applying effects, cuts, sound, transitions, and thoughtful edits.

### 2. 🎬 Your Exported .MP4 Video

When your video is complete, you need to **export** it as an `.mp4` file so others can watch it.

#### How to export:
1. In Premiere Pro, go to the top menu:  
   **File → Export → Media**
2. Under the **Format**, choose:  
   `H.264`
3. Under **Preset**, choose:  
   `Match Source – High Bitrate`
4. Click the **Output Name** to rename your file and choose where to save it

5. Make sure you save it to the correct folder:

6. Click **Export**

> [!NOTE]
> An `.mp4` is the **final video file** — just like a finished YouTube video — that can be watched on any device.  
> Saving it in the `Exports/` folder keeps your projects tidy and easy to locate.

### 3. 💾 Your `.prproj` File

This is your **Premiere Pro project file** — it saves all your edits, cuts, effects, and layout, but **does NOT** include your media files.

Think of it like a control panel that tells Premiere where everything is and what to do.

You’ll find your `.prproj` file inside the folder where you first saved your project. Make sure you save it inside:

This file lets your teacher see how your project was built, and lets you continue working on it later without losing any of your timeline structure.

> [!TIP]
> Never save your `.prproj` file to your Downloads folder or Desktop — always put it in the right place!

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Submitting all three parts gives a complete picture of your work:
- The **screenshot** shows your editing process  
- The **.mp4** shows the final product  
- The **.prproj** shows your creative decisions in detail

This also ensures you always have a **back-up** of your work and can build strong habits for professional workflows.

## 📁 About Your .prproj File

Your **Premiere Pro project file (.prproj)** only stores the **edits**, not the actual media. This means it keeps track of your timeline, cuts, effects, and settings, but it does *not* contain your video clips, audio, graphics, or images.

I will not ask you to submit your media files on a daily basis in Notion. However, it is **crucial** that you keep all of your media organized inside the folder structure we created earlier. If your files are scattered across Downloads or your Desktop, your project may break — and you won’t be able to reopen it properly.

There may be times when you’ll need to submit your media files along with your project.  
For example: if your editing project isn’t opening on your computer, or if I need to review your full workflow for troubleshooting, I might ask you to upload your `.prproj` file **and** all your media so I can open the project exactly as you built it.

Keeping your media organized now ensures you're ready for that situation, and it keeps your editing process smooth and professional.
