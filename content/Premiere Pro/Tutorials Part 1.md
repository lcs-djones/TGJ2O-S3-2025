# 🎬 Premiere Pro Tutorials: Getting Started

## Why We’re Doing This
Before we start creating our own video projects, it’s important to build a solid foundation by completing **Premiere Pro’s built-in tutorials**. These short, guided lessons walk you through essential editing skills like importing footage, trimming clips, adding titles, and exporting your final video.  

By completing these tutorials, you’ll not only learn the basic workflow of Premiere Pro, but you’ll also start building confidence to edit independently in future projects.

> 💡 **Remember:** Tutorials are a key part of your learning portfolio. You must complete **all required tutorials** and provide **screenshots as evidence** in your **Notion post** for each one. Be sure your screenshots clearly show that you finished the tutorial.
