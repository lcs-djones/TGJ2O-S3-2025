# 🎬 What Makes a Good Edit?
### Premiere Pro Introduction Activity

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
Before we dive into editing in Premiere Pro, it’s important to recognize **what good editing looks and feels like**. Editors make creative choices about how to cut, transition, and pace a story — and those choices are what keep the audience engaged.  

In this activity, you’ll find and analyze a short video that demonstrates strong, intentional editing.  

---

## 🪜 Instructions  

### Step 1: Find a Video  
Search for a video on **YouTube** that meets the following criteria:  

✅ Between **1–5 minutes long**  
✅ **Edited intentionally** (not a raw vlog, gameplay clip, or meme)  
✅ **School-appropriate** in both language and visuals  
✅ Includes clear examples of **cuts, transitions, and pacing choices**  

Examples you could choose:  
- A movie trailer or short film  
- A music video  
- A well-edited YouTube vlog or mini-documentary  
- A highlight reel (sports, travel, etc.) with good pacing and transitions  

Once you’ve found your video, **copy and paste the section below into a blank Notion entry** and complete it.

### 🔍 Editing Analysis

**1. How would you describe the overall pacing of the video?** (Fast, slow, balanced? How does that fit the mood?)

**2. What kinds of cuts or transitions did you notice?** (Straight cuts, fades, cross dissolves, jump cuts, match cuts, etc.)

**3. How did the music or sound effects support the editing choices?** (Did cuts line up with beats or sound changes?)

**4. Was there any B-roll or extra footage used to help tell the story?** (Describe how it was used effectively.)

**5. What was your favourite moment of editing in this video, and why did it stand out to you?**

### 💭 Reflection

**6. What do you think the editor wanted the audience to feel or focus on?** (Explain what emotion or message the edit communicated.)

**7. How do you think the same footage would feel if it were edited differently?** (For example, slower pacing, different music, fewer cuts.)

**8. What’s one editing technique from this video that you’d like to try yourself once Premiere Pro is installed?**

### 🧩 Wrap-Up Summary

**In 2–3 sentences, summarize what makes an edit “good.”**
