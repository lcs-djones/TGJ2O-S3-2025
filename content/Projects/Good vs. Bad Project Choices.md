# 🎯 How to Pick a Strong Project (and Avoid a Weak One)

Choosing the **right project** is the most important decision you will make this mod. A strong project sets you up for success, momentum, and meaningful feedback. A weak project creates stress, vague work, and last-minute scrambling.

This page exists to help you **self-filter** ideas *before* submitting a proposal.

## 🧠 The Core Question to Ask Yourself

Before committing to a project, you should be able to clearly answer:

> **Who is this for, why does it matter, and when does it need to exist?**

If you cannot answer all three clearly, the project is not ready yet.

---

## ✅ What a Strong Project Looks Like

A strong project has most or all of the following traits:

- A **real audience or client**
- A **clear purpose** (document, promote, celebrate, explain, preserve)
- A **defined final product** (you know exactly what you will hand in)
- A **real context or moment** (event, deadline, or specific need)
- A **scope that fits the time we have**
- A **reason to exist beyond this class**

These projects are easier to plan, easier to manage, and result in higher-quality work.

---

## ❌ What a Weak Project Usually Looks Like

Weak projects often sound reasonable at first, but fall apart quickly. Common red flags include:

- “Just for fun” with no real audience
- No clear deadline or reason it needs to exist *now*
- Very vague deliverables (“some photos”, “a video”, “a design”)
- Overly ambitious ideas with no realistic plan
- Projects that are essentially practice exercises disguised as real work

If a project mainly exists to **fill time**, it will show in the final result.

## 🟢 Good vs 🔴 Weak Project Examples

### 🎬 Video

**🟢 Strong**
- A highlight video for a specific school team to be shared at an assembly
- A short documentary on a club preparing for a tournament
- A tutorial video created for incoming students

**🔴 Weak**
- “A cool cinematic video with random shots”
- “A vlog about my week”
- “A video where I try out editing styles”

---

### 🎧 Audio

**🟢 Strong**
- A podcast episode for a school initiative or club
- Audio interviews archived for a department or event
- Background music composed for a school video or presentation

**🔴 Weak**
- “A podcast where I talk about random topics”
- “An audio project to experiment with sounds”
- “Music just to see what happens”

---

### 📷 Photography / Design (Photoshop)

**🟢 Strong**
- Edited portraits for a team, club, or school publication
- Photo edits designed for posters, announcements, or displays
- A themed photo series documenting a school event

**🔴 Weak**
- “Some edited photos I like”
- “Practicing filters and effects”
- “Random pictures from around campus”

---

### 🛠️ Design & Object Creation (3D Printing)

**🟢 Strong**
- 3D-printed signage or tools for a classroom or club
- Props for a school production or event
- Awards, trophies, or functional school items

**🔴 Weak**
- “A cool thing I want to print”
- Downloading and printing an existing model with no modification
- Objects with no clear use or audience

---

## ⚖️ Balancing the Three Course Focus Areas

Over the remainder of the year, you are expected to work across **all three major course areas**:

- 🛠️ **Design & Object Creation (3D Printing)**
- 🖼️ **Photo Editing / Design (Photoshop)**
- 🎬 **Video Editing (Premiere Pro)**

This does **not** mean every project must include all three.  
It **does** mean that over time, your project choices should show **balanced engagement** with each area.

By the end of the year:
- You should have completed meaningful work in **each** focus area
- You should be spending a **roughly even number of classes** working in each stream
- Your Notion entries and submissions should clearly reflect this balance

### Exceptions

In some cases, it may make sense to spend **more time in one area** than another.  
Exceptions can be made **only after a discussion with Mr. Jones** and are approved **at his discretion**.

Be prepared to explain:
- Why the imbalance makes sense
- How it supports your learning
- How you are still meeting overall course expectations

---

## ⏱️ Not All Projects Take the Same Amount of Time (Plan Accordingly)

Different types of projects naturally take **different lengths of time**, and that is expected.

For example:
- 🎬 **Premiere Pro projects** often take longer due to filming, importing, editing, revisions, and feedback cycles
- 🛠️ **3D printing projects** may involve shorter bursts of work but include test prints, iteration, and machine wait times
- 🖼️ **Photoshop projects** often fall somewhere in between, depending on complexity

Because of this:
- Plan projects **intentionally**, not randomly
- A shorter project in one area may be balanced by a longer project in another
- Your time plan should reflect **realistic effort**, not just equal project counts

The goal is **balanced time and learning over the long term**, not identical projects or identical timelines.

## 🧭 Final Self-Check Before Submitting

Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself:

- Is this project real?
- Does it have a clear audience and purpose?
- Do I know exactly what I’m making?
- Does the scope match the time available?
- Does it fit into my overall balance across course areas?

If you can confidently answer **yes** to all of these, you are likely starting with a strong project.
