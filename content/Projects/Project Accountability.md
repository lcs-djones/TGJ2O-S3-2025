# 🔒 Freedom & Accountability in This Mod

This mod is designed to give you a **high level of freedom**. You choose the project, the direction, the tools, and often the timeline.

That freedom only works if it is matched with **accountability**.

In real creative and professional environments, freedom is not given unconditionally. It is **earned, maintained, or lost** based on how responsibly you work. This mod is meant to mirror that reality.

---

## 🎯 What Freedom Looks Like in This Mod

You are trusted to:
- Choose a meaningful project
- Manage your own time
- Work independently or with approved collaborators
- Decide how to plan and produce your work
- Use class time productively

This is not “free time.”  
It is **self-directed professional time**.

---

## 📌 What Accountability Means

Accountability means you:
- Show up prepared and ready to work
- Use class time for the project you proposed
- Make visible progress every class
- Track your time honestly
- Communicate when problems arise
- Follow through on commitments

If you are using your time well, it will be obvious in your work and documentation.

---

## 📓 How You Show Accountability

You demonstrate accountability through:

- **Daily Notion entries**  
  Clear, specific updates about what you worked on, decisions you made, and next steps.

- **Planning before production**  
  No jumping straight into “making” without approved planning documents.

- **Consistent progress**  
  Work should move forward every class, not just at the end.

- **Peer feedback**  
  Actively giving and receiving critique, then applying it.

- **One-on-one check-ins**  
  Being able to explain what you are doing, why, and what comes next.

---

## 🚫 What Breaks Trust

The following actions show a lack of accountability:

- Treating class time as free time
- Doing minimal or vague Notion entries
- Waiting until deadlines to start real work
- Ignoring feedback or check-ins
- Working on things unrelated to your approved project
- Relying on excuses instead of communication

When trust breaks down, freedom is reduced.

---

## 🔄 What Happens If Accountability Slips

This mod is flexible, but not unlimited.

If accountability becomes an issue, you may:
- Lose the ability to work outside of class time
- Be given more structured checkpoints
- Be assigned a specific project or tighter constraints
- Have your freedom scaled back temporarily

This is not a punishment. It is a reset.

---

## 🧠 The Real-World Parallel

In creative, technical, and professional environments:
- No one micromanages you if you are reliable
- Missed deadlines have real consequences
- Communication matters as much as talent
- Independence is earned through consistency

This mod is training you for that reality.

---

## ✅ Bottom Line

You are being trusted with:
- Time
- Choice
- Independence

What you do with that trust matters.

Use it well, and this will be one of the most rewarding mods of the year.
