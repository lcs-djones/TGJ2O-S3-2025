# 🎬 Mod 2: Project Proposal & Planning Guide

Welcome to Mod 2! Starting now, you’ll be designing and producing your own **independent project** related to one of the five course focus areas:

> 🎬 Video  🎧 Audio  📷 Photography  📰 Print/Web  🛠️ Design & Object Creation

These projects are **real-world**, **student-driven**, and **tied to the school or school community** in some meaningful way. You have full creative control over the format and direction of your work — but with that freedom comes responsibility.

---

## ✅ What’s the Point?

This is your chance to:
- Build something real that makes an impact
- Work like a professional — planning, pitching, revising, and delivering
- Choose projects that interest you and develop skills in the areas you enjoy
- Manage your time like a real creator

---

## 📋 What Makes a Strong Project?

Your project must:
- Be tied to at least **one of the five course areas**
- Be connected to something **real** in the school community (no mock clients or fake events)
- Serve a **clear purpose** (celebration, documentation, promotion, etc.)
- Be **planned out ahead of time** with deliverables and deadlines
- Be completed **individually by default** (group work only with special approval)
- Be part of your broader course goal: completing a project in **each of the five areas by the end of the course**

## 💡 Examples of Project Ideas

Here are just a few ideas and examples to get you thinking. You’re encouraged to come up with your own.

### 🎬 Video
- Short doc about a school team or club
- Highlights reel for an event
- Video tutorial for new students

### 🎧 Audio
- School podcast segment
- Audio tour of artwork or displays
- Custom remix or musical piece for school use

### 📷 Photography
- Portraits of students, teams, or staff
- Day-in-the-life candid photo set
- Edited gallery for yearbook or hallway display

### 📰 Print/Web
- Posters for upcoming events or causes
- Infographics or awareness campaigns
- Digital newsletter layout or zine

### 🛠️ Design/Object
- Custom signage or room labels
- Laser-cut awards or plaques
- 3D-printed props for a school production

## 🧠 Proposal Requirements

You must submit a written proposal that includes:
- Project title
- Your name
- 1–2 sentence project description
- What course area(s) it connects to
- Who the project is for (audience or client)
- What the final product will be
- Tools/software you’ll use
- Estimated weekly work plan (see time log)
- Description of your planning materials (see below)
- Why this project matters (personally or to the school)

Your proposal will be assessed as part of your **Thinking** mark (KTCA). Once approved, you can begin working on the planning phase.

---

## 🧾 Planning Expectations

Because each project is unique, there is no universal template. It’s your responsibility to figure out what planning tools your specific project needs. You must **submit your planning materials and have them approved before you begin working on the actual production.**

Some examples:
- 🎬 **Video** → storyboard or shot list (etc)
- 🎧 **Podcast** → written questions or topic outline (etc)
- 📰 **Poster** → design mockups + peer feedback cycle (etc)
- 📷 **Photography** → shot plan or editing plan (etc)
- 🛠️ **3D/Laser** → sketches, test prints, technical specs (etc)

You’ll also be expected to gather **peer feedback** throughout your process — whether you’re designing, editing, writing, or building, your project should grow based on critique and revision.

---

## ⏱️ Time Commitment & Flexibility

Each student is expected to spend about **1.5 hours per class** working on this course. That means if you have 2 classes a week, you owe about 3 hours of project work that week.

If your project involves **working outside of school time** (e.g. filming a basketball game on a weekend), you can count that time **toward your in-class hours — but only if it is pre-approved**.

> Example: You film for 1.5 hours on Saturday. That counts toward Monday’s class, and you can use that class for other productive work (with permission).

**All out-of-class work must be:**
- Clearly written in your proposal
- Approved in advance by your teacher
- Tracked using the time log template

⚠️ This is a privilege. If time is being misused or not accounted for, you may lose the ability to work outside class time.

---

## 🗓️ Weekly Time Log Template

In your proposal, include a simple weekly plan like this:

| Day        | Activity                          | Est. Time | In-Class or Out-of-Class |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Monday     | Edit poster mockup + feedback     | 1.5 hrs   | In-Class                  |
| Wednesday  | Film volleyball game highlights   | 1.5 hrs   | Out-of-Class (pre-approved) |
| Friday     | Clip + organize game footage      | 1.5 hrs   | In-Class                  |

---

## ✅ Pre-Production Flow

All projects follow this general workflow:

1. **Submit proposal**
2. **Get feedback and make adjustments**
3. **Submit planning documents (storyboards, mockups, scripts, etc.)**
4. **Begin production**
5. **Gather and apply peer feedback throughout**
6. **Submit final product**
7. **Complete a reflection**

---

## 📓 Daily Check-Ins & Accountability

You’ll be expected to:
- Write a brief update in Notion **every class**
- Share progress, challenges, goals, and what you worked on
- Participate in one-on-one check-ins with your teacher during class

This helps you stay on track, reflect on your process, and receive timely feedback.

---

## 📅 Deadlines & Real-World Expectations

There is no single deadline that applies to everyone — because projects vary in size and timing. However, all projects must:

- Follow **realistic deadlines** based on their purpose (e.g. a poster for a school dance must be ready *before* the dance)
- Show consistent weekly progress

There are no strict penalties for late proposals, but poor planning shows up in your final evaluation — and in real life, missed deadlines have real consequences. Plan wisely.

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

Before submitting your proposal, make sure:
- [ ] The project is real and tied to the school
- [ ] You’ve chosen a valid course stream (video/audio/etc.)
- [ ] You’ve described your final product clearly
- [ ] You’ve outlined your weekly time plan
- [ ] You know what planning documents you’ll need
- [ ] You’re ready to take responsibility for the full process

## 🧭 Questions?

If you’re stuck, can’t think of an idea, or aren’t sure how to plan something, talk to your teacher. You’ll be assigned a project if needed — but this is your opportunity to do something meaningful, creative, and real.

Make it count.
