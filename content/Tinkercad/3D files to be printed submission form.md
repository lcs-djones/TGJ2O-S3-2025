# New 3D Print Request System – Why We’re Using It

As we’ve moved further into 3D printing this year, the **volume of print requests has grown a lot**, especially with multiple classes and clubs running at the same time. This is a good problem to have, but it has also made it clear that the way prints were being tracked before is no longer sustainable.

I want to be upfront here: **falling behind on keeping track of prints is on me**. This is my first time managing this many active printers, projects, classes, and clubs simultaneously, and relying on informal hand-offs, messages, or scattered uploads just doesn’t scale. Prints were too easy to miss, forget, or lose track of.

This new system is meant to fix that.

## Why We’re Switching to a Print Request Form

The new Google Form gives us a **single, consistent place** for all print requests. This makes the entire process:

- Easier to manage
- Fairer across classes and clubs
- More transparent for everyone
- Less prone to things being forgotten or lost

Every submission is timestamped, labeled, and stored in one place. That means:
- I can queue prints more efficiently  
- You can be confident your file was actually submitted  
- We spend less class time troubleshooting logistics  

Ultimately, this helps us spend **more time designing, iterating, and learning**, and less time chasing files.

## Important Clarification: This Does *Not* Replace Notion

Nothing about your **regular Notion submission process changes**.

You are **still expected to**:
- Complete your Notion entry during the assigned class time
- Document your process, tools, screenshots, and reflections
- Treat Notion as your primary learning evidence and portfolio

The print request form is **not** a reflection, assessment, or documentation tool.

## What the Form *Is* (and Is Not)

### The form **IS**:
- For students who want their model physically printed
- A way to submit the actual STL/3MF file for printing
- A way to communicate print-specific details (size, material, supports, etc.)

### The form **IS NOT**:
- A replacement for Notion
- A shortcut around documentation
- Required if you do not care about receiving a physical print

If you **do not care about getting your piece printed**, simply continue with your normal Notion submission and move on. That is completely fine.

## Bottom Line

- **Notion is still mandatory for everyone**
- **The print request form is only for those who want a physical print**
- This change exists to make the process smoother, fairer, and more reliable

Thanks for your patience as we improve the system. This should make the rest of the unit run much more smoothly for all of us.
