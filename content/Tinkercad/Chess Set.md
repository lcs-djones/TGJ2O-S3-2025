## Objective
Create a set of chess pieces that are your own designs and that follow a specific theme. 

The chess pieces should have 3 seperate elements, a broad base, a central body and a head.

## What you'll need to begin
Ensure that you are on our classroom for TinkerCad and review the [[Tinkercad/Submitting your Tinkercad files|file submission standards]] as well as the [[Tinkercad/3D Printing Principles & Rules]]. You will need a pencil and paper and to find a partner to give and receive peer feedback.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] A hand-drawn plan is made for each of your thematic chess pieces
- [ ] The models are evidently unique to each other and represent the 6 different chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen & King)
- [ ] You consistently give and receive peer feedback that is used to influence and adapt your design
- [ ] Your chess pieces are designed to be realistically printable
- [ ] Your design and iteration process is shown throughout the assingment

## Choosing a Theme

You will design and 3D print chess pieces, each reflecting a unique theme of your choice. Your theme could be something broad, like nature, space, or pirates etc., or you can dive into a specific properties like Marvel, Star Wars, Barbie etc. The theme will guide the design of each piece, creating a cohesive and visually stunning chess set. Let your creativity shine! Once you have chosen a theme, confirm with Mr. Jones.

## Sketch and Design
Draw out your 2 chosen chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen & King) on graph paper. This will act as your initial design.  The pieces should be easily recognisable as their appropriate piece (example: There should be no confusion on if a piece is a Pawn or a Rook). These sketches should be included in your Notion post as part of your planning process.

>[!tip] Remember to keep in mind the principles of 3D modeling when sketching and designing.

## Peer Feedback
Show your sketches to a peer. The peer should give you 3 pieces of constructive feedback for your sketches. This feedback can be with regards to your theme, your model printing success or anything else that is relevant. The three pieces of constructed feedback that you receive should be included in your notion post so make sure you write them down!

>[!remember] Constructive feedback needs to be
>1. Helpful
>2. Specific
>3. Kind

>[!example]
>> "It is really good, I think it looks cool. There is some stuff that you could fix like the top of it" is **KIND**, but it is not **SPECIFIC**, or **HELPFUL**
>> 
>>"The proportions of your windows are really accurate! The columns are really close to accurate but are a bit off near the top as they look thinner than the real thing. If you use the technique you did for the windows on the columns to get them more accurate, I think it would really elevate your project!" is an example of **GOOD** peer feedback.

## 3D Modelling 
When designing your chess piece in TinkerCad, keep in mind scale! Your chess pieces should be close to these standardized sizes! (Creative liberties are exceptions within reason)

You can copy/paste designs from one project to another on TinkerCad. If you run out of space on your workplane making the pieces, create another project and then when you are finished, copy/paste them all into one project.

	</iframe>
	</div>
 <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>


When you are done one of your pieces, receive one more piece of kind, specific and helpful constructive feedback. Make the recommended change and note of it in your Notion post for today. When your pieces are done, follow the [[Submitting your Tinkercad files|file submission standards]]. 

>[!todo] Submission 
>Let Mr. Jones know when you have completed a chess piece and [[Submitting your Tinkercad files|submitted properly]], so that I can add it to the print queue.



>[!info] Keeping your pieces 
>When ==all== of your chess pieces are completed, you can take them home with you, however as we work on this project, you must leave them with me in the classroom to ensure that they do not get lost and that we can keep them together.


Reprints will only happen in certain circumstances, so make sure that you get it right!

## Reflection Questions  

When you are finished your 3D Chess sets, copy and paste the following questions into your Notion entry and answer them in complete sentences:  

---

### Reflection Questions

1. Which piece are you most proud of, and why? What specific design or modelling choices made it successful?  
2. Which piece was the most challenging to create, and what strategies or techniques did you use to overcome those challenges?  
3. What design or technical skills improved the most for you during this project?  
4. Describe one problem you encountered during the modelling or printing process and how you solved it.  
5. What advice would you give to a future student starting this same project?

✅ **Reminder:**  
Be honest, detailed, and specific in your responses. Include screenshots or photos of your work if relevant to your answers.
