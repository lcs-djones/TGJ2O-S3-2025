 It will not take long before you are able to create some impressive models. You will have the chance to print these models on our 3D printer here at LCS.

>One of Mr. Jones' students at TCS last year had no previous 3D modeling experience, but by the end of the unit, the student was able to model and print an accurate rendition of the Colosseum.
