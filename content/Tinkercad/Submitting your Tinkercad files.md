## Include the STL file

Be sure to submit an STL file with each of your portfolio posts.

> [!TIP]
> 
> The easiest way to add your STL file to a portfolio post is to simply drag and drop it into the post you've created on Notion.

## What is an STL file?

In the same way that a JPEG file holds the data that describes an image, and an MP3 file holds data that describes a song, a STL file holds data that describes the 3D models we create in Tinkercad.

## How do I get my STL file?

At the top right of Tinkercad, click on **Export**:

Next, click on .STL, then save it to a folder on your computer. It is recommended that you create a folder made specifically for this module of the course, and keep all the .STL files you download from Tinkercad there. Alternatively, create a [[Creating a Smart Folder|smart folder]] that looks for .STL files on your computer.

> When saving a model in Tinkercad, if you have only part of the model selected when going to export, it will default to:

>  `The selected shape`

>  This option means that Tinkercad will export only what you have highlighted within your design.
>  
>  So, please make sure that you have:
>  
>  - selected no elements of your design 
>  - selected *all* elements of your design
>    
>  ...or, that you remember to select `Everything in the design` when exporting to an STL file, so that your full design is included.

## How do I upload the STL file?

Drag and drop the .STL file into Notion.

The entire process of exporting and then submitting an .STL file is shown here:
